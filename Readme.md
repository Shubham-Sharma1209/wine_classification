This is for the Data Science Project.
In this project an exploratory analysis on wine dataset is performed and quality is determined from the model prepared.The type feature was dropped due to an error in oversampling.
To analyze the model, three different classifiers which are Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Extra tress classifier were used for analysis. Out of which, the Extra Trees Classifier was used as it had the highest accuracy score and cross validations mean score.
